## Task 0 — the contact-frame trace (blocking, run before any hit-stop code)

**Why it blocks.** Hit-stop holds **one drawn frame** for 4–9 ticks. `combatTiming.ts:101-107`
warns, from a failure this project's sibling already paid for, that *"spending the full `startup`
puts the contact frame on the last active tick instead of the first"*, and that it is findable
**only** by tracing the sim's state frame against `anims.currentFrame` live. No gate in this phase
can see it. If the freeze holds a wind-up pose, every timing number in the plan is spent holding the
wrong picture.

### Method

`npm run dev` on :5173, driven with the `playwright-cli` skill. A recorder installed in-page sampled
once per animation frame — `window.__game.tick`, `world.player.state`, `world.player.combatCounter`,
`playerSprite.anims.currentAnim.key`, `.currentFrame.index` and `.currentFrame.textureFrame` — then
`F` (attack) was pressed and the series deduped by tick. 668 samples across the swing.

### Result — RED CASE. The contact frame is on the LAST ticks of the active window.

The project's own reach gate, run against the shipped sheet:

```
$ node tools/gen/sheetGates.mjs brass-courier attack
PASS   brass-courier/attack   G4   drift 0px within budget 3px (3px + 0px allowance)
PASS   brass-courier/attack   G5   frame 4 (tick 9) lands inside the active window [6, 10)
```

The live trace, tick by tick. `ATTACK = { startup: 6, active: 4, recovery: 10 }`, so
`attackPhase` puts the live hitbox on `combatCounter ∈ [6, 10)`:

| combatCounter | phase | anims index | **texture frame** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–2 | startup | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | startup | 2 | 1 |
| 4–6 | startup → **active at 6** | 3 | 2 |
| 7 | active | 4 | 3 |
| **8** | **active** | **5** | **4 ← contact** |
| **9** | **active (last tick)** | **5** | **4 ← contact** |
| 10–11 | recovery | 6 | 5 |
| 12–19 | recovery | 7–10 | 6–9 |

The attack clip has **10 frames** (`anims index = textureFrame + 1`) spread over a 20-tick swing.

> 🔴 **This line said 12 until 2026-08-20, and the table directly above it always said 10.** It lists
> texture frames 0-9 and anims indices 1-10; `public/assets/index.json` ships `brass-courier-attack`
> at `frameCount: 10, simTicks: 20, fps: 30`, and 20 ticks at 60 Hz is 0.333 s, which is 10 frames at
> 30 fps. Three independent sources agreed and the prose disagreed with all of them. Caught by the
> Task 2 implementer when its dispatch — which had copied the wrong number out of this file — told it
> to read the catalog instead of hard-coding the count. **The contact-frame conclusion is unaffected:**
> contact is texture frame 4, which is `frames[4]`, on `combatCounter` 8-9. *(vault C9 again, and this
> time in the document the code is told to cite.)*

**G5 passes and is still a red flag for this phase.** G5 only asks whether contact falls *inside*
the window. It falls on ticks 8 and 9 — the **last two** of four. A hit normally lands on the
**first** live tick (`combatCounter === 6`), where the drawn pose is texture frame 2, a mid-wind-up.

### Decision — snap to the contact frame on freeze (owner approved, 2026-08-20)

When the freeze begins the sprite is forced to the **contact frame (texture frame 4)** and paused
there; on release the swing resumes. Every timing number in the plan stands unchanged, no art is
regenerated, and no combat knob moves — so `combatTiming.ts`'s balance warning is not triggered.

Rejected alternative: hold whatever frame happens to be drawn. That is the documented failure, it
depends on *where in the window* the hit landed, and nothing in the suite can catch it — it would
surface only at the hands-on pass, after the timing numbers had been tuned around the wrong feel.

### Second finding, free, and it constrains the implementation

The first attempt at capturing a held contact frame set `anims.setCurrentFrame(...)` plus
`anims.pause()` from outside the game loop. The screenshot came back showing an **idle** pose:
`gamePlayerDraw.ts` re-derives the animation from sim state **every frame**, so an externally set
frame is overwritten within one frame.

**Consequence:** the freeze's animation pause and contact-frame snap must live **inside** the render
path, recomputed each frame from a sim predicate — the `goalEntryAlpha` no-teardown pattern
(`playerView.ts:115-123`), which is what the plan already specifies. A one-shot call from anywhere
else is silently undone.

### Evidence

The trace table and the gate output above are the evidence, and both are reproducible by the method
described. **No screenshot is filed**: the only image captured showed the overwritten idle pose and
would have been misleading, so it was deleted rather than filed. Visual confirmation that the snap
reads as impact is **owed at the hands-on pass** and is tracked under criterion 9.8.

### Housekeeping

Dev server killed by port after the trace *(C13)*; browser closed.

## 9.8 — what the gates do NOT cover (draft, finalised at the gate)

1. **Whether 4 ticks reads as "solid" or "mushy".** No assertion distinguishes 3, 4 and 5 ticks.
   Owner picks blind from clips at three `?hitstop=` scales.
2. **Whether a light hit and a killing blow are distinguishable at play speed**, without a
   side-by-side. The tests prove they differ numerically, not that a player notices.
3. **Whether the freeze reads as impact or as a dropped frame.** The phase's central risk, no metric.
4. **Whether the contact-frame snap reads as impact** rather than as a skipped frame. Owed at the
   hands-on pass; see Task 0.
5. **The shipped particle configuration is below the measurement floor** and is not measured; the
   perf gate covers the amplified storm only, divided back.
6. **"Max enemies" is not a real bound.** `docs/qa/phase-05-combat-08-gate-10.md:121` finding S5,
   still open: *"`DEV_FLEET_COUNT = 20` is a chosen multiple, not a bound — nothing in `src/sim/` or
   the level format caps concurrent enemies."* The gate pins the declared worst case, not the
   possible one.
7. **Batch-flush counts are not measured.** Phaser 4.2.1 exposes no per-frame draw-call counter this
   project already reads. The depth-band claim is argued from render-node mechanics and enforced only
   by a unit assertion that every `EFFECT_DEPTH` lies strictly in `(10, 11)`.
8. **Spark colour reading as brass-on-steel** rather than generic orange — by eye.
9. **The demo criterion — "hits feel like they land" — has no assertion of any kind.**
